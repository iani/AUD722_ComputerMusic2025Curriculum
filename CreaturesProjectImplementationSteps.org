#+title: Creatures Project: Implementation Steps and Class Scenario

* For Instructors: Guiding the Project

This document outlines the steps for implementing the "Algorithmic Sound Environment" project. It is designed to be shared with students and to provide a framework for your class sessions.

The key to a successful project is to guide the students through a process of conceptualization, implementation, and collaboration. The provided scenario ("The Sentient Forest") is a starting point; feel free to adapt it or to create a new one with your students.

* For Students: Project Instructions

**1. Concept**

The semester project for class AUD722 is to create a multichannel sound installation. This installation will be an immersive, generative soundscape created by a collection of "sound creatures" that react to a changing environment.

We will be creating a "Sentient Forest." This environment has its own internal clock and logic, and it cycles through a series of "states."

Each of you will design and program one "sound creature" that inhabits this forest. Your creature will have a set of unique sonic "behaviors" that it expresses in response to the environmental states.

**2. The Environment: The Sentient Forest**

The environment is the master controller of the installation. It will be a central SuperCollider program that cycles through a predefined set of states. These states can follow a narrative arc.

**2.1 Option: Day-Night Cycle**

*   **Dawn:** The forest is waking up. The sun is rising, and the air is cool and damp.
*   **Day:** The forest is alive with activity. The sun is bright, and the creatures of the forest are foraging and communicating.
*   **Dusk:** The sun is setting, and the forest is preparing for night. The mood is calm and peaceful.
*   **Night:** The forest is dark and mysterious. The nocturnal creatures emerge, and the sounds of the day are replaced by the sounds of the night.

**2.2 Option: Weather**

*   **Storm:** A sudden storm rolls in, with wind, rain, and thunder. The creatures of the forest take shelter.
*   **Sunlight:** The amount of sunlight (0.0 at night, 1.0 at the peak of the day).
*   **Temperature:** The temperature of the forest (0.0 during the coldest part of the night, 1.0 during the warmest part of the day).
*   **Humidity:** The amount of moisture in the air (increases during the storm).
*   **Wind Speed:** The intensity of the wind (peaks during the storm).

**2.3 Option: Evolutionary**

*   **Hunger:** The creatures take actions to find food, including hunting, grabbing plants, setting traps
*   **Reproduction:** The creatures mate and/or take care of their offspring
*   **Danger:** The creatures face danger by entering the "fight or flight" mode

For each state, the environment will broadcast a set of parameters to all the sound creatures via OSC messages. These parameters will be normalized values (0.0 to 1.0):


**3. Your Task: The Sound Creature**

You are responsible for one sound creature. Your task is to program a set of "behaviors" for your creature in SuperCollider. A behavior is a sound-producing algorithm that takes the environment's parameters as input and uses them to control the synthesis process.

For example, your creature might:

*   Be a "songbird" that sings more frequently as `~sunlight` increases.
*   Be an "insect" that buzzes more intensely as the `~temperature` rises.
*   Be a "tree frog" that croaks more often when the `~humidity` is high.
*   Be a "small mammal" that makes frightened sounds when the `~wind_speed` is high.

The goal is to create a creature that feels "alive" and responsive to its environment.

**4. Project Deliverables**

1.  **A written description of your creature:** What is its conceptual basis? What kinds of sounds does it make? How does it behave in response to the different environmental states?
2.  **A SuperCollider class for your creature:** This class will contain the synthesis and logic for your creature's behaviors. It must be able to receive OSC messages from the environment and use them to control its sound production.
3.  **A set of sound files (if needed):** You can use pre-recorded sounds in your synthesis algorithms.

* A Scenario for Guiding Class Sessions

This scenario provides a narrative structure for the project and can be used to guide your class sessions.

**Session 1: Conceptualization**

*   **Introduction to the project:** Present the "Sentient Forest" scenario to the students.
*   **Brainstorming:** As a class, brainstorm the different kinds of creatures that might inhabit this forest. Encourage students to think about the relationships between the creatures and their environment.
*   **Individual concept development:** Each student should choose a creature to develop and write a short description of its concept and behaviors.

**Session 2: Technical Workshop**

*   **OSC communication:** Give a technical demonstration of how to send and receive OSC messages in SuperCollider.
*   **Parameter mapping:** Show students how to map the incoming environmental parameters to the parameters of their synthesis algorithms.
*   **Class structure:** Provide a template for the creature class that students can use as a starting point.

**Session 3: Implementation and Peer Feedback**

*   **In-class work session:** Students work on implementing their creature classes.
*   **Peer feedback:** In small groups, students present their work-in-progress to their peers and give and receive feedback.

**Session 4: Integration and Rehearsal**

*   **Integration:** As a class, integrate all of the creature classes into the main environment program.
*   **Rehearsal:** Run the full installation and listen to how the different creatures interact with each other and with the environment.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Debug any technical issues that arise.

**Session 5: Final Presentation**

*   **Public presentation:** Present the sound installation to the public.
*   **Discussion:** After the presentation, have a discussion with the audience about the project and the creative process.
