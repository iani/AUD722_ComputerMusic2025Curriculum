#+title: AuD722class Project

The semester project for class AUD722 is a multichannel sound installation presenting the sounds designed and programmed by the students of the class.  The concept for the sound installation is based on the idea of an environment in which run several processes called "sound creatures". Each sound creature produces sound according algorithms (programs) programmed by the students in SuperCollider and called "behaviors".  Each student is responsible for creating the behaviors for one sound creature.  Furthermore, each sound creature changes behavior according to a set of input parameters received from the environment.  The algorithm that produces the input parameters through an algorithm called "state".  The environment and sends these parameters to all sound creatures in order to guide their behaviors.  Additionally, the environment changes between a set of states in the course of time.
